I am fluent in both Windows and OSX and am beginning to explore GNU/Linux distros.</p>\r\n		<p>Client-side development is my forté however I am still very interested in Server-side (particularly NodeJs). I am most comfortable working with MEAN stacks. I also have some experience with LAMP, and a small amount of exposure to Laravel.</p>\r\n		<p>In terms of design, my style has developed drastically over the past four years of study. I began my degree intending to major in illustration however, upon being exposed to different styles of work, I now tend toward minimalism, typography and grids.</p>\r\n		<p>I am really interested in UI/UX design and love the challenge of designing creative yet intuitive web applications.

This research project is an attempt to create a foundation document outlining the tenets of Design-Led Innovation. I made the choice to use light weight, low cost news print as a medium to maximise efficiency in distribution. I experimented with a risograph as a means of printing however the decades-old technology gave out on me half way through the project. This led me to explore other means of printing, including screen printing, for which I settled. The use of newsprint opened new possibilities of folding to change the form of the manifesto. I thought this was particularly appropriate as it reflects the malleability of Design-Led Innovation as a theory. It can be read in three different forms, two of which are more succinct summaries of the theory.</p>\r\n		<p>This project was selected to be a part of the permanent design gallery at AUT. It was selected to be featured on <a href="http://www.designassembly.org.nz/articles/tag/liam-wheeton" target="_blank">Design-Assembly</a> and also nominated for Best Awards 2014.</p>\r\n		\r\n		<button id="dli">View Gallery</button>\r\n\r\n	</section>\r\n\r\n	<section>\r\n\r\n		<h2>Logo Design</h2>\r\n\r\n		<p>This is a selection of logos I have designed over the last four years.

The concept behind this web app is real time tracking of police checkpoints.</p>\r\n		<p>A user can navigate to the page and track on a live map the locations that other users have stored indicating the location of speed traps. A user can create an account and contribute indicators.</p>\r\n		<p>The site has basic functionality including form validation and writing to a Mongo database (account creation and storing location pins) however some aspects are unfinished. I would like to continue this project and add a voting system where users may \'upvote\' or \'downvote\' indicators if there is or is not police activity in the area. If an indicator recieves a certain number of downvotes the marker and all its information would be wiped from the database. I would also like to add a timer to indicators so they expire after an elapsed period. Small UI features like user account information also need to be added. The site is still very buggy. For best functionality view on a mobile device.</p>\r\n		<p>The project utilizes sockets.io for real time updates.</p>\r\n		<p>I chose the name custodes to elude to the Roman Poet Juvenal\'s phrase "Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?" roughly translating to "Who watches the watchmen." I developed the custodes logo and identity around a roman aesthetic.</p>\r\n\r\n		<a href="http://188.166.180.154:3000/#/" class="link" target="_blank">View Site</a>\r\n\r\n	</section>\r\n</div>')}]);
