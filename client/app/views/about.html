		<h2>About—</h2>
		<p>I am 23 years old and graduated from AUT with a Bachelor of Design majoring in Graphic Design in 2014. I then followed up with a Diploma of Web Development graduating from that in 2015.</p>
		<p>I am a confident user of the Adobe Creative Suite, particularly inDesign and Illustrator, and I have proficent knowledge of Photoshop. I am fluent in both Windows and OSX and am beginning to explore GNU/Linux distros.</p>
		<p>Client-side development is my forté however I am still very interested in Server-side (particularly NodeJs). I am most comfortable working with MEAN stacks. I also have some experience with LAMP, and a small amount of exposure to Laravel.</p>
		<p>In terms of design, my style has developed drastically over the past four years of study. I began my degree intending to major in illustration however, upon being exposed to different styles of work, I now tend toward minimalism, typography and grids.</p>
		<p>I am really interested in UI/UX design and love the challenge of designing creative yet intuitive web applications. I hope some day to take my career to New York or Northern California.</p>
